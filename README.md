# Another AngularJS CLI (AAC)

This is another AngularJS CLI to manage and create Angular > 2 projects, but instead using complex command line instructions, it uses [inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to ask questions to the user to configure the creation process.

So right now, you can create a full minimalistic project, but I pretend to cover more functionality with time.

To use it, just install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/another-angularjs-cli):

```bash
npm -g install another-angularjs-cli
```

And create a new project just typing __aac__ and answering a few questions.

Have fun :)
